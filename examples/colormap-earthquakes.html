title: Earthquakes Colormap
shortdesc: Demonstrates the use of a colormap layer.
docs: >
  This example parses a KML file and renders the features as a <code>ol.layer.Colormap</code> layer.
  Instead of mapping the density of points to different color, it uses the weight of a point.
  In this example, different colors indicate the different magnitude of earthquakes. Unfortunately, since
  all events in this data set have only one of four values (5.0, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3) you
  won't see a significant difference.
